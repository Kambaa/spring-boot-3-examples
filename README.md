## Spring Boot Application Demos On Every Branch:

I don't like how tutorial-givers write their code on a _multi-module_, _"everything is in there, go get it"_ style
project so here, i'll try to make a repo that has a **one demo on a single branch**, only required project files will be
added. Here's the current list:

| Branch Name            | Description                                                                              | 
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| master                 | default branch that is a template for the other branches.                                |
| basic-h2-crud-example  | A basic spring boot application that has embedded H2 database and CRUD operations on it. |
| openapi-ui-basic-setup | Quick setup of openapi-ui (usually known as swagger-ui) on spring boot 3.                |
